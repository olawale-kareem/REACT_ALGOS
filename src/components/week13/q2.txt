The difference between the useLocation and useHistory is the difference

useLocation : useLocation gives information about the current url and updates the components anytime the url changes
useHistory : useHistory only gives functions and primitives to manipulate or get information about  the current url

for example 

function Analytics(){
    const { path } = useLocation();
    return path
}

The function above always return the current information about a page
